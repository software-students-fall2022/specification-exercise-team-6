## Stakeholders

### Stakeholder: Luca Washenko, Founder & CEO of [Rise New York](https://risenewyork.shop/)
We believe Luca is a good representation of the type of person for whom we are trying to design this mobile app for, as he is the founder of the company and could shed a lot of insight into what consumers are looking for.

### Overview of Company: 
Rise has created a zero nicotine, caffeine-only diffuser with all natural ingredients. Their primary demographic is Gen-Z, or people ages 18-24. They appeal to students, coffee drinkers looking for different ways to supplement their caffeine intake, and individuals that are trying to reduce their nicotine intake. 

### Goals: 
His biggest goal is to get Rise diffusers into more hands. To be more specific, he has the following goals:
1. A larger online presence
2. Simplification of the the ordering process and increased presence in stores
3. Increase brand awareness
4. Stay competitive as more caffeine-diffusers pop up (more flavors, better prices, incentives to try Rise, etc.)

### Problems / Frustrations:
1. He finds it difficult to stay in touch with consumers without being too invasive. He relies primarily on emailing existing customers (with new deals or reminders to stock up) but emails typically have lower conversion rates. SMS blasts are possible but are incredibly costly. He needs a way to communicate more easily. 
2. One of his goals is to simplify the ordering process because right now he believes restocking on Rise bars monthly requires too much manual power (remembering to purchase it, putting in your address and credit card information, etc.). He is frustrated with the current obstacles it takes to complete an order. 
3. For the users of Rise that are switching from nicotine, he has no concrete way of knowing if Rise is effective. He has access to reviews, comments, and repurchase rates, but besides that, it is unable to confirm that his product helps people quit nicotine. 
4. As a founder and someone who wants to increase brand awareness, he is always looking to partner with influencers. However, this frustrates him as there is no easy way of finding influencers, seeing their effectiveness, knowing their rates, etc. He says if there was a consolidated application that accumulated all of this information, it'd be easier to identify the influencers he is interested in working with. 

## Product Vision Statement

The Rise New York mobile application is a one-stop shop for users to buy and restock their Rise diffusers, while intuitively tracking their nicotine and caffeine intakes. 

## User Requirements

1. As a new Rise user, I want to be able to purchase a Rise diffuser with minimal obstacles so I don’t have to spend time researching different offerings and instead can shop quickly and easily. (Potential Features: comparisons against competitors, one-click ordering)
2. As a returning Rise user, I want the platform to keep track of my previous purchases and recommend the same quantity / flavors to me so that I don’t have to waste time when restocking. (Potential Features: one-click ordering, user profiles, monthly subscriptions)
3. As a frequent user of Rise, I want the Rise platform to automatically ship me a new diffuser when my current diffuser is running low on juice so that I don’t have to manually purchase it myself. (Potential Features: monthly subscriptions, user profiles)
4. As a user switching to Rise to reduce my nicotine intake, I want to be able to track my nicotine levels to ensure that Rise is actually working for me. (Potential Features: nicotine usage tracking)
5. As a user of Rise hoping to control my caffeine intake, I want to be able to track my caffeine levels to ensure that Rise is actually working for me as a caffeine alternative. (Potential Features: caffeine usage tracking)
6.  As a frequent caffeine user, I want to be able to consume caffeine anywhere and at any time, irrespective of my proximity to a coffee shop, so that I can feel energized. (Potential Features: quick delivery of Rise products, more brand awareness)
7. As a student, I want to be able to see healthy alternatives to traditional vape products so that I can avoid inhaling harmful substances. (Potential Features: comparison against competitors)
8. As a money-conscious consumer, I want Rise to let me know in a non-invasive way (not SMS messages) when there are discounts or promotions on Rise products so that I can save money. (Potential Features: notifications to a user's phone [typically has higher conversion rates], incentive programs [every dollar spent on Rise products accumulates 1 point], deals & discounts)
9. As a monthly subscriber to Rise, I want to be able to receive monthly reminder notifications that my new Rise diffuser is on its way so that I can regulate my usage. (Potential Features: notifications to a user's phone, monthly subscription model)
10. As an executive at Rise, I want to be able to track user metrics on the app (monthly recurring customers, application download numbers, application opens, etc.), promote the brand, and more efficiently communicate with customers, so I can streamline the company’s success. (Potential Features: all of the ones listed above)
